       I am a freshly graduated  web developer. Drawn to the charm of the Basque Country, I chose to settle in this region renowned for its emphasis on nature and outdoor sports. Combining my passion for technology with my love for nature, I am currently seeking an apprenticeship in a socially responsible and solidarity-based company. I aspire to contribute to projects that merge technological development with positive social impact, utilizing my skills to serve a cause that is close to my heart.
